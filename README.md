# FriendlyChat Codelab

This is the completed project code for the two Google Codelabs: 

- [Firebase: Build a Real Time Web Chat App Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-web/).
- [Firebase SDK for Cloud Functions Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-cloud-functions/)

The first Codelab shows how to build a chat app (FriendlyChat App) on Firebase.  The second Codelab shows how to add three Google Cloud Functions to the FriendlyChat App.

Google Cloud Functions:

- New users are greeted by a bot
- Uploaded pictures are processed by Google Cloud Vision and blurred if found to be offensive
- A new message noification bot is implemented

The app is hosted on Firebase at: [FriendlyChat2](https://friendlychat2-3c045.firebaseapp.com/)

The docs folder contains notes for both code labs.https://friendlychat2-3c045.firebaseapp.com/)
