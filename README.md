## About

This is the completed project code for the two Google Codelabs:

- [Codelab: Firebase Web Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-web/).
- [Codelab: Cloud Functions for Firebase](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-cloud-functions/)

The first Codelab shows how to build a chat app (FriendlyChat App) on Firebase. The second Codelab shows how to add three Google Cloud Functions to the FriendlyChat App.

Google Cloud Functions:

- New users are greeted by a bot
- Uploaded pictures are processed by Google Cloud Vision and blurred if found to be offensive
- A new message noification bot is implemented

The app is hosted on Firebase at: [FriendlyChat2](https://friendlychat2-3c045.firebaseapp.com/)

The docs folder contains notes for both code labs.
