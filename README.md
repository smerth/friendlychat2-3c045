# Firebase SDK for Cloud Functions Codelab - Start code

This folder contains the finished code for the Google Codelab: [Firebase SDK for Cloud Functions Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-cloud-functions/).

This adds three Google Cloud Functions to the original FriendlyChat app built in the Google Codelab: [Firebase: Build a Real Time Web Chat App Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-web/).

Google Cloud Functions were written for:

- New users are greeted by a bot
- Uploaded pictures are processed by Google Cloud Vision and blurred if found to be offensive
- A new message noification bot is implemented

The app is hosted at: [FriendlyChat2](https://friendlychat2-3c045.firebaseapp.com/)
